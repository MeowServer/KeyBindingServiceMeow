Here's a simple instruction to develop using this plugin:  
There 2 major way to bind a key to your action:
| Method | Advantage | Disadvantage |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| HotKey | Player can know which key the plugin is using and customize it using command | You have to create a HotKey instance and register it for every single player|
| Event | Easy to use.  | It is not customizable and not visible for players |
## Example
1. Hot Key
```CSharp
var hotKey = new HotKey(KeyCode.YourKeyCode, "ID", "Name", "Descriptoin(optional)", "Category(optional)");
hotKey.KeyPressed += YourMethod;
API.Features.HotKey.HotKeyBinder.RegisterKey(ev.Player, hotKeys);
```
2. Event
```CSharp
API.Event.Events.RegisterKeyToEvent(KeyCode.YourKeyCode);
API.Event.Events.KeyPressed += OnKeyPressed;
```
When using OnKeyPressed event, you must first register your key using RegisterKeyToEvent method.
